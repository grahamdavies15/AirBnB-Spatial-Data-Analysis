# AirBnB-Spatial-Data-Analysis
An applied spatial data analysis project for AirBnB dataset around Cape Town.

Spatial Point Pattern Analysis:
In this part of the assignment, I analyse the locations of the listings in two wards compare the ward level information using methods such as quadrat counts, spatial point pattern models etc.

Spatial Lattice Data Analysis:
In this part of the assignment, I build spatial lag and error models that predict the average price of the listings within all 116 wards using some of the variables provided.
