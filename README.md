# AirBnB-Spatial-Data-Analysis
An applied spatial data analysis project for AirBnB dataset around Cape Town.

Spatial Point Pattern Analysis
In this part of the assignment, I analyse the locations of the listings in your allocated wards and compare the two ward level information using all the methods you have seen such as quadrat counts, spatial point pattern models etc.

Spatial Lattice Data Analysis
In this part of the assignment, I build spatial lag and error models that will predict the average price of the listings within all 116 wards using some of the variables provided.
